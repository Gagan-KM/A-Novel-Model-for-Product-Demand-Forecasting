A Novel Model for Product Demand Forecasting

Overview

The rapidly growing smartphone market has intensified competition among platforms. This project aims to answer two key questions:

What are the adoption trends for smartphones?
How can we estimate the demand for new smartphones?

Lack of proper planning is a major factor in the failure of small businesses, as noted by Business Know-How. When launching a new product, companies are particularly vulnerable if they do not follow a well-structured plan. Conducting due diligence before manufacturing and marketing a new product is crucial to determine if it is a wise business decision.
